#### Grid Localization using Bayes Filter.
#### Objective Given:
The objective of this assignment is to make you familiar with Grid Localization which is a variant ofdiscrete Bayes Localization. In addition you will learn how to use ROS Bags and visualize in Rviz.

#### Tasks performed:
1. Created a ROS node named-'a_star.py' to implement the A-Star Algorithm in python. 
2. Used the A-Star Algorithm to create a global plan for the robot to reach its goal.
3. Created a ROS node named-'sensor_sub.py' to implement the VFH Algorithm in python using the sensor data fetched.
4. Used VFH to create a local plan for robot navigation to follow the global path with obstacle av√•oidance.


##### Issues:
Minor Flaw in Sesor Model.
