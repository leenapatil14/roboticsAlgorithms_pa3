#### Grid Localization using Bayes Filter.
#### Objective Given:
The objective of this assignment is to make you familiar with Grid Localization which is a variant of discrete Bayes Localization. In addition you will learn how to use ROS Bags and visualize in Rviz.

#### Tasks performed:
1. Created a ROS node named-'sensor_sub.py' to implement the Bayes Filter in python. 
2. Read the provided rosbag and collected movements and measurements data, created functions to change all quaternions to eulers and vice versa.
3. Created odomentry motion model.
4. Created sensor model.


##### Issues:
Minor Flaw in Sesor Model.
